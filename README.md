## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to build a multi-section landing page that dynamically added content to the page. Specifically to the navigation menu. In addition to this, another goal was to improve the user experience such that when a user selects an menu item on the menu, the item will scroll the user to the corresponding section. And said section being viewed will be visually differentiated from the others. The langugaes used in this project were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to this README file, there are three files: index.html, style.css, and app.js. These are all needed to run this project.

## Takeaways
This project gave me the opportunity to integrate skills from previous projects, HTML & CSS, with JavaScript in a more complex project. I also built on my understanding of the DOM and how to manipulate it. As well as improve the overall user experience when interacting with websites.

## Resources
I utilized Javascript Tutorial (javascripttutorial.net) as a resource to get a helper function that would assist me in checking if a section was in the viewport: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/
