## Project Summary

The goal of this project was to build a multi-section landing page that dynamically added content to the page. Specifically to the navigation menu. In addition to this, another goal was to improve the user experience such that when a user selects an menu item on the menu, the item will scroll the user to the corresponding section. And said section being viewed will be visually differentiated from the others.

## Takeaways
This project gave me the opportunity to integrate skills from previous projects, HTML & CSS, with JavaScript in a more complex project. I also built on my understanding of the DOM and how to manipulate it. As well as improve the overall user experience when interacting with websites. 

## Details
The langugaes used in this project were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to this README file, there are three files: index.html, style.css, and app.js. These are all needed to run this project. 

## Resources
I utilized Javascript Tutorial (javascripttutorial.net) as a resource to get a helper function that would assist me in checking if a section was in the viewport: https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-is-visible-in-the-viewport/
